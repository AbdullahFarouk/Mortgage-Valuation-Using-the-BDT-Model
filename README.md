# Mortgage-Valuation-Using-the-BDT-Model
This model uses the binomial tree valuation model to value the mortgage over a span of 30 years. The binomial model uses an iterative procedure, allowing for the specification of nodes or points in time, during the time span between the valuation date and expiration date of the mortgage. This allows for a mathematical valuation of the mortgage value at each point in time specified by the nodes. The borrower has two options when paying back the mortgage: he can choose to not refinance and continue paying the incremental payments or refinance the mortgage.The optimal mortgage rate is thus 2.9% for free refinancing and 3.3% for costly (5%) refinancing. At higher rates the borrower becomes better off at the expense of the lender. In the case of  costly (5%) refinancing, the borrower will choose the continuous payment option till the 3.3% rate and after the 3.3% rate, the borrower will prefer refinancing since his mortgage value will be lower.
